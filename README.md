The code defines dictionaries `dictionary_registers` and `dictionary_functions`, which map register names and opcodes to their binary representations, respectively. It also defines different types of instructions based on their opcode patterns.
The function `decimal_to_binary` takes a decimal number, converts it to a binary string representation, and returns the binary string as a 7-bit value.
The function `assemble` is the main entry point of the code. It takes an input file path and an output file path as parameters.
Inside `assemble`, we initialize variables, labels, and instructions lists, and set a counter `c` to 0.
We read the input file line by line, and if a line starts with the keyword "var," we increment the counter `c`.
We set the variable `l` to the length of the remaining lines after the "var" declarations.
We process each line of the input file. If a line contains a label (identified by the presence of a colon), we extract the label and add it to the `labels` dictionary with its corresponding line number (subtracting `c`). We then append the instruction part of the line to the `instructions` list.
If a line does not contain a label, we directly append the instruction part of the line to the `instructions` list.
After processing all the lines, we check if the last instruction is "hlt." If not, we raise a syntax error.
For each instruction in the `instructions` list, we call the `process_instruction` function. It takes an instruction, line number, `variables`, `labels`, `instructions`, and `l` as parameters and returns the binary representation of the instruction.
Inside `process_instruction`, we build the binary string representation of the instruction based on the opcode and operands.
If the opcode is "var," we add the variable to the `variables` dictionary with its corresponding line number (calculated using `l`, `line_number`, and `c`).
If the opcode is "mov," it is handled separately from the other types of instructions.
If the opcode is not present in the `dictionary_functions`, we raise a syntax error.
Depending on the type of instruction (A, B, C, D, E, F), we build the binary string by appending the corresponding opcode, register codes, and immediate values.
We use the `decimal_to_binary` function to convert immediate values to binary strings.
We return the `binary_string`.
Finally, we write the binary instructions to the output file. The code takes an input file, processes the instructions, converts them to their binary representations, and writes the binary instructions to the output file. It also handles various error conditions and provides meaningful error messages.
